"""Write-approval gate + pending store for memory and skill writes.

Background
----------
The agent writes to two persistent stores that survive across sessions:

  * **memory** — MEMORY.md / USER.md, small (~200 char) declarative entries
  * **skills** — SKILL.md + supporting files, potentially huge (10-100 KB)

Both stores are written from two origins:

  * **foreground** — a normal agent turn (user is present / chatting)
  * **background_review** — the self-improvement review fork that runs after a
    turn and autonomously decides what to save (the source of the
    "wrong assumptions" users complained about)

Agent skill writes always stage for operator approval; ``skills.write_approval``
is deprecated and ignored. Memory retains its boolean ``memory.write_approval``:
false allows writes, while true prompts inline or stages them for review.

The size asymmetry between memory and skills is real and unavoidable: a memory
entry can be reviewed inline in a chat bubble; a 100 KB SKILL.md cannot. So
the gate stages BOTH to disk, but review affordances differ by subsystem
(see ``lliam_cli`` slash handlers): memory shows full content, skills show
metadata + a one-line gist + a ``diff`` escape hatch (CLI/dashboard/file).

When memory approval is enabled, background and gateway memory writes stage
for ``/memory pending`` review; foreground CLI writes can prompt inline.
Skill writes always stage, regardless of origin or configuration.

Pending records live under ``<HERMES_HOME>/pending/{memory,skills}/<id>.json``
so they survive process restarts and can be reviewed from CLI, gateway, or the
web dashboard.
